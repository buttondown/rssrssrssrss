# rssrssrss

A simple, stateless SPA that allows users to combine multiple RSS feeds into a single RSS feed URL.

## Features

- Combine any number of RSS feeds into a single feed
- Simple, intuitive interface
- No account required - just enter your feeds and get a URL
- Combined feeds are sorted by date (newest first)
- Original source information is preserved in the merged feed
- RSS feeds are compressed using LZ-string for better compression, and then [translated into a URI-friendly alphabet space](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/blob/master/src/encodedURIComponent/compressToEncodedURIComponent.ts)
